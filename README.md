# Real-time Object Detection System for Traffic Monitoring
In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore the application of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for the purpose of detecting and classifying vehicles in traffic. The ability to accurately detect different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, etc.) is crucial for various applications, including traffic management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. YOLOv5, being one of the fastest and most accurate object detection algorithms available, offers an efficient way to tackle this challenge
Model Training: Using the prepared dataset, we will train a YOLOv5 model. The training process will be optimized to achieve high accuracy for vehicle detection.
Evaluation: After training, the model's performance will be evaluated using standard metrics like precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision). We will also visualize the detection results on test images.
Real-Time Detection: Finally, we will demonstrate how to apply the trained YOLOv5 model for real-time vehicle detection using video data from traffic cameras
