In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore the application of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for the purpose of detecting and classifying vehicles in traffic. The ability to accurately detect different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, etc.) is crucial for various applications, including traffic management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. YOLOv5, being one of the fastest and most accurate object detection algorithms available, offers an efficient way to tackle this challenge
